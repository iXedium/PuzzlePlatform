# Puzzle Platform Tracker

## Project Goals
- Develop a platform puzzle game in Unity.
- Incorporate Game Creator 2 instructions and properties.
- Ensure smooth platform movement with features such as obstacle and border detection.
- Maintain existing features and ensure no functionality is lost in any iteration.

## Ground Rules
1. Existing features must not be lost during modifications.
2. Any new features must integrate seamlessly with current functionality.
3. Code changes must respect the structure and logic of the current scripts.
4. Always review this tracker file to understand the project goals, current tasks, and context before making changes.
5. When completing tasks, update this tracker with what was done and identify upcoming tasks.
6. **CRITICAL RULE**: No existing feature should ever be removed or compromised. Any new logic must integrate seamlessly with the current features and structure. All tasks must be approached with a deep understanding of the codebase and the relationships between systems.

## Features to Preserve
- **Smooth Movement**: Consecutive identical commands should result in uninterrupted movement animations.
- **Mid-Sequence Obstacle Detection**: If an obstacle is encountered during a smooth move, the animation should adjust, and reverse logic should trigger as needed.
- **Bounds-Based Detection**: Platform movement must respect its full volume when checking for collisions and boundaries.

## Current Tasks
- ✓ Implement bounds-based detection for obstacles and borders.
- ✓ Update `ExecuteCommandSequence` to maintain smooth movement while using bounds-based detection.
- ✓ Enhance `SmoothMove` to properly handle mid-sequence obstacle detection.
- ✓ Integrate acceleration/deceleration curves with obstacle detection.

## Completed Tasks
- Restored smooth movement functionality for consecutive identical commands.
- Reintegrated mid-sequence obstacle detection with proper animation adjustments.
- Implemented bounds-based detection that works seamlessly with existing features.
- Added proper acceleration and deceleration curves to smooth movement.

## Upcoming Tasks
- Test all features extensively to ensure functionality and integration.
- Optimize performance of bounds-based detection if necessary.
- Consider adding visual feedback for obstacle detection and movement boundaries.
- Document the implementation for clarity and future iterations.

## Implementation Notes
- Bounds-based detection now considers the platform's full volume.
- Smooth movement preserves acceleration/deceleration while maintaining obstacle awareness.
- Reverse sequence properly handles interrupted movements and returns to starting position.
