# Puzzle Platform Tracker

## Project Goals
- Develop a platform puzzle game in Unity.
- Incorporate Game Creator 2 instructions and properties.
- Ensure smooth platform movement with features such as obstacle and border detection.
- Maintain existing features and ensure no functionality is lost in any iteration.

## Ground Rules
1. Existing features must not be lost during modifications.
2. Any new features must integrate seamlessly with current functionality.
3. Code changes must respect the structure and logic of the current scripts.
4. Always review this tracker file to understand the project goals, current tasks, and context before making changes.
5. When completing tasks, update this tracker with what was done and identify upcoming tasks.

## Features to Preserve
- **Smooth Movement**: Consecutive identical commands should result in uninterrupted movement animations.
- **Mid-Sequence Obstacle Detection**: If an obstacle is encountered during a smooth move, the animation should adjust, and reverse logic should trigger as needed.

## Current Tasks
- Implement bounds-based detection for obstacles and borders.
- Update `ExecuteCommandSequence` to use new cell-based detection methods while preserving existing features.

## Completed Tasks
*(None yet)*

## Upcoming Tasks
- Refine and optimize the current implementation for performance, if necessary.
- Test all features extensively to ensure functionality and integration.
- Document the implementation for clarity and future iterations.
